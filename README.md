# The Wheel

Created using React.js
--  --  --
```js
Guest credentials:
 - username: MidnightMist
 - password: 12345
 ```
 
 
 Login using the correct credentials and then rotate the wheel as many times as you can. This example demonstrates how basic react.js components provide operational properties to a page. Continuing, the example provides the following but is not limited too below: 
 
 - Implemented a simple login form with username and password inputs, which checks if the credentials match the ones stored in the client-side state.
 - Used local storage to store user information and checked if a user is logged in or not by checking the local storage values.
 - Implemented form validation to ensure that the user enters the correct type of data for each field, such as a valid username or password with a minimum length.
 - Utilized an external tutorial and combined it with custom styling techniques to create visually appealing and cohesive design elements.
 - Utilized descriptive comments to explain the purpose, function, and behavior of each component, function, and variable within the code.
